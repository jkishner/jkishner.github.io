			<description>&lt;p&gt;This essay on Paula Deen was an entertaining, informative read. It was published in the online magazine Matter on Medium.

				&lt;p&gt;I've been &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/09/18/testdrivingIos8BeforeIUpgradeMyIphone.html&quot;&gt;playing&lt;/a&gt; with Extensions and Today screen widgets in iOS 8 on my iPad, and I'm just fine still using my 4s with iOS 7. Some iOS 8 features add convenience, but a javascript bookmarklet to add an article to Instapaper works just as well as an Instapaper extension. There is currently nothing in iOS 8 that I feel I &lt;i&gt;have to have&lt;/i&gt; on my iPhone.&lt;img style=&quot;float: right; margin-left: 25px; margin-bottom: 15px;&quot; src=&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/6j12d7oothm37uf/iphone_hero_medium.jpg?dl=0&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;The only app whose release I &quot;dread&quot; is &quot;Drafts&quot;, because I know that it will be iOS 8-only and will sync with Cloudkit. As long as I keep my iPhone as-is, I will not be able to upgrade to Drafts even on my iPad if I want to sync notes between my devices.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Where to Linkblog?</title>
			<link>http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/10/06/whereToLinkblog.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;I used to have a linkblog on a subdomain of Dave Winer's smallpict.com, and used the Fargo &lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io/docs/blogging/linkblogging.html&quot;&gt;bookmarklet&lt;/a&gt; to quickly add links to my linkblog outline. Then when Dave released &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio3.io&quot;&gt;Radio3&lt;/a&gt; I started using &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio3.smallpict.com/2014/08/30/bookmarkletHowto.html&quot;&gt;bookmarklet&lt;/a&gt; to add links. However, even though with Radio3 I can have &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio3.io/users/kishner/&quot;&gt;my own linkblog&lt;/a&gt; that cross-posts to Twitter and has an RSS feed, that's not on my own domain. If Dave released Radio3 on GitHub and I could run it from my own server, then I would feel I have more control over it. But for all his writing on silos, Radio3 itself is a silo. If Dave takes the site down, I lose my linkblog, even if all the links have been shared on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for now I'm going to share links on my regular blog. If you're reading it on the web, a shared link will be preceded by |link|. If you're reading this in a feed reader, you'll see &amp;verbar;link&amp;verbar; preceding the link title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether I share something here or on Twitter (or both) will be a crapshoot. Sometimes the decision is dictated by the device I am using at the time I want to share a link. I hate using Fargo.io on mobile devices, so it's easier then to just use Tweetbot. But if I'm at a desktop computer, I'll more likely share it here -- unless I am so incensed about a story that I want to share it also (or exclusively) on Twitter. I &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; share a headline from Fargo on Twitter using the following script, but the tweet always needs editing before I post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;%reader (&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/3fpz0pjbxy5io8s/8f327e3f7fa1a04865e7dd11bdb95a88.opml?dl=0&quot;)%&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Fargo scripting blog&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/kishner&quot;&gt;follow me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; as well!&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>How I'm Reading Feeds These Days</title>
			<link>http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/10/03/howImReadingFeedsTheseDays.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;I'm enjoying reading my &quot;rivers of news&quot; over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio3.io/rivers&quot;&gt;Radio3&lt;/a&gt; now that &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/09/26/runningRiver4OnTheCheapLocallyAndWithDropbox&quot;&gt;I'm running river.js locally&lt;/a&gt;. I still use &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedafever.com&quot;&gt;Fever&lt;/a&gt;, but currently only to see what's Hot. Anytime I see a blog I like, I just add its feed to Fever as a &quot;spark.&quot; Fever runs an algorithm to see what URLs are linked-to frequently among all my feeds within a specified time frame, and presents those as Hot links. So if I want to get a quick overview of what My Part of the Internet is talking about, I look at Fever. My rivers, on the other hand, include only the blogs I &lt;i&gt;truly&lt;/i&gt; follow. I can do this just as easily with Fever groups, but right now I like my rivers.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;&lt;%icon (&quot;fa fa-quote-left&quot;)%&gt; If this Foo Fighters style parody falls flat, it's because the Foos don't really have a style worthy of parodying. Take away Dave Grohl's songwriting chops and supremely likable personality, and you're left with rousing yet fairly bland arena rock.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.billboard.com/articles/review/6157649/weird-al-yankovic-mandatory-fun-album-review&quot;&gt;&lt;%icon (&quot;fa fa-external-link&quot;)%&gt; 'Weird Al' Yankovic's 'Mandatory Fun': Track-by-Track Album Review&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;I came upon this album review by Kenneth Partridge after doing a Google search to prove to my daughter that &quot;My Own Eyes&quot; was indeed a Foo Fighters genre parody (i.e., of the band's style, not a specific song). What struck me was the line, &quot;Take away Dave Grohl's songwriting chops.&quot; Take away his chops and you &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; have bland arena rock. That's why he fronts the Foo Fighters and not, say, Nickelback. &lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Running River4 On the Cheap: Locally and with Dropbox </title>
			<link>http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/09/26/runningRiver4OnTheCheapLocallyAndWithDropbox.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://river4.smallpict.com/2014/09/25/bareBonesRiver4Howto.html&quot;&gt;The latest release of River4&lt;/a&gt; allows a user to bypass Amazon S3 and instead write all data to the local machine. This is &lt;i&gt;big news&lt;/i&gt; -- the cost of bandwidth and all of the reading/writing from the node.js installation to Amazon &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/09/03/theCostOfRiver4.html&quot;&gt;is not cheap&lt;/a&gt;. Although Dave Winer has said that the &quot;river of news&quot; is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a feed reader, they feel equivalent enough that I don't want to be paying $20 a month just to create JSON files and host a river, when competitive feed readers are much less expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial problem with running River4 locally is that one would need to use the web server as a host, and not all web servers have that capability. For instance, I am running River4 on a VPS that does not have a fixed IP address. However, there is a workaround: Dropbox. One can't view the index.html file of the river on the web (even when made shareable) but one &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; make all of the JSON files shareable, and plug them in where they are referenced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created a &lt;i&gt;river4&lt;/i&gt; subdirectory in Dropbox, put a &lt;i&gt;lists &lt;/i&gt;folder in it, and added my OPML files. Because I have Dropbox installed on my Linux VPS, river.js can read/write to/from &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; subdirectory. All I had to do was go into .bashrc, put a &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; in front of my original s3path, and add the following line: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;export fspath=/root/Dropbox/river4/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After &lt;code&gt;source ~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; I stopped and restarted river.js, and the app started to write files to the Dropbox folder. I then had to make the JSON files shareable. For example, if I go to Dropbox/river4/rivers and make &lt;i&gt;daveWiner.js&lt;/i&gt; shareable, I get &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/qb3vl228x7mc970/daveWiner.js?dl=0&quot;&gt;https://www.dropbox.com/s/qb3vl228x7mc970/daveWiner.js?dl=0&lt;/a&gt;. To show the raw code, I change &lt;code&gt;www&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;dl&lt;/code&gt; and hit enter, and get &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/qb3vl228x7mc970/daveWiner.js?dl=0&quot;&gt;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/qb3vl228x7mc970/daveWiner.js?dl=0&lt;/a&gt;. I can now plug this into the Settings at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio3.io/rivers&quot;&gt;Radio3 River Browser&lt;/a&gt; or replace the URL in the &lt;i&gt;riversArray.json&lt;/i&gt; file in the data folder (although you'll have to do that in a copy in a different folder, otherwise the app will just rewrite over it if you add a new OPML file to the &lt;i&gt;lists&lt;/i&gt; folder). Then I go to (as of this writing) line 706 of the &lt;i&gt;index.html&lt;/i&gt; file and change the following line &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;readHttpFile (&quot;data/riversArray.json&quot;, function (jsontext) {&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;such that the file that it reads points to where you are hosting the JSON file. This could be the shared Dropbox URL, if you change the URL to show the raw code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Special thanks&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriven.chrisdadswell.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Chris Dadswell&lt;/a&gt; for helping me think this through.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Switching This Fargo Blog from blogHome to Stream Template</title>
			<link>http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/09/25/switchingThisFargoBlogFromBloghomeToStreamTemplate.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;As an experiment I am converting this blog to the stream template (which is what Dave Winer is using at &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com&quot;&gt;Scripting&lt;/a&gt;). I was looking at &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriven.chrisdadswell.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Chris Dadswell's blog&lt;/a&gt; (as well as his &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/77dh8j4y3ql7zbe/scriven.opml?dl=0&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt;) and realized that a stream blog can still contain &lt;i&gt;type=&quot;outline&quot;&lt;/i&gt; posts. For example, here is &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriven.chrisdadswell.co.uk/2014/09/25/&quot;&gt;the 9/25 stream&lt;/a&gt; and here is &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriven.chrisdadswell.co.uk/2014/09/25/riverOfNewsNowWithLocalStorageOption.html&quot;&gt;one of his outline posts from 9/25&lt;/a&gt;. The RSS feed points to the full posts so the stream template is not a disservice to readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I've done as of this writing is change this blog from &lt;i&gt;blogHome&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;stream&lt;/i&gt; and remove everything in my &lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;%customStylesScripts%&gt;&lt;/i&gt; in the #glossary other than my Google Analytics script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside is that the stream template does not support Markdown -- which is what I've written virtually all of my outline posts in -- so many of my posts on the home page will be presented as written (i.e., not converted to HTML). If I stick to writing in HTML then this formatting error will pass over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will also add a permalink at the end of each post, so that if you are reading it on the home page, you can click over to the post itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i&gt;Want to comment?

			<title>Subscribe to Me in the Radio3 River Browser</title>
			<link>http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/09/24/subscribeToMeInTheRadio3RiverBrowser.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;Dave Winer recently released his most cutting-edge product, RiverBrowser. It is the &quot;river of news&quot; living at Radio3.io, which is his new linkblogging tool, where you can post a link simultaneously to Twitter, Facebook, a WordPress blog, and your Radio3 page. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RiverBrowser depends on River4 or earlier (e.g. River 3). River4 is software running on the node.js framework that converts OPML subscription lists (of RSS feeds) into a JSON file, that is then rendered as a river of news. Setting up River4 is pretty darn complicated if you are not comfortable with Unix and Amazon Web Services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the default RiverBrowser at &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio3.io/rivers/#&quot;&gt;http://radio3.io/rivers/#&lt;/a&gt;, which contains Dave Winer's tabs. But you can follow my latest blog and linkblog posts by adding a JSON URL that I've generated in my own River4 installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you're at the RiverBrowser page, sign on to Twitter. Then click on Rivers, and then My Rivers. Click the plus sign, and in the new row, enter &lt;code&gt;Jeff&lt;/code&gt; on the left and &lt;code&gt;http://river.jeffreykishner.com/rivers/jeff.js&lt;/code&gt; on the right. Save, and you'll see a new tab with any feeds that I've added to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/7tti43z92f0egsw/jeffFeeds.opml?dl=0&quot;&gt;my OPML file&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Lev Grossman's Magicians Trilogy</title>
			<link>http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/09/22/levGrossmansMagiciansTrilogy.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;I just finished reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://levgrossman.com/magicians-trilogy/&quot;&gt;this series&lt;/a&gt;. There are few novels that I feel compelled to pick up outside of my subway commute, and these books belong to that category. I did not unequivocally love them, but they were all good reads. Think &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; but young American adults who curse and have sex; or a dark &lt;em&gt;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While reading the first two books, I really wanted magic to be real. When I was in my late twenties or early thirties I tried some candle magick, and nothing came of it. It's possible that I just was not able to summon strong enough emotional energy and will it into a change in circumstances. But then we get into tricky territory, like &quot;Be the change you want to happen&quot; or all that &lt;em&gt;The Secret&lt;/em&gt; philosophy. Of course that's different than shooting light out of your fingers or flying, but essentially I think magic is about our emotions and our surroundings being One.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One takeaway from these books is that you have to know yourself and know what you want to create something new. There is no room for ambivalence in magic, or at least if you're ambivalent the results of magic could turn out grotesque or half-formed. As a Pisces -- which is a mutable sign -- I often swim in both directions at once, so don't have the strong &lt;em&gt;I have to go in THIS direction and abandon everything else&lt;/em&gt; that I associate with a zodiac sign more suited for magic, like Scorpio. So maybe if magic &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; real, it's just not for me. I tend to be more suited towards changing consciousness than changing matter.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;I don't think my tweets are anything special, but it occurred to me last night that I can use this blog as a repository of selected tweets so that more of my microblogging can be found in the same place. Dave Winer's &lt;a href=&quot;http://happyfriends.camp&quot;&gt;Happy Friends&lt;/a&gt; makes it easy to copy and paste tweets into a Fargo.io blog, because it exports an opml file on the web that can be viewed as a tab in Fargo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here are yesterday's tweets in which I am not communicating with someone specific or promoting my own blog posts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it is not the case that I will do anything for pastries&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;todo.txt nerds, I have a quicken question that won't fit in 140: &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/ZjijRyHXGi&quot;&gt;https://t.co/ZjijRyHXGi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my fav part of iOS8 extensions is that they obviate the need to install javascript bookmarklets&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>CloudKit Dammit!</title>
			<link>http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/09/18/cloudkitDammit.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;I just learned that the new version of &quot;Drafts&quot; will be using CloudKit and will drop Simperium sync. So &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/09/18/testdrivingIos8BeforeIUpgradeMyIphone.html&quot;&gt;if I choose not to upgrade my iPhone&lt;/a&gt; and want to try the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/agiletortoise/044d3f20b3f1a94aa2f7&quot;&gt;iOS-8-only version of Drafts&lt;/a&gt; on my iPad, I will not be able to sync my drafts between the two devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/kishner&quot;&gt;@kishner&lt;/a&gt; Yes. Using CloudKit for sync.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/kishner&quot;&gt;@kishner&lt;/a&gt; You will have to stay on the current version (which works fine on 8).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use Drafts pretty much daily, and I have written God knows how many Dropbox, Evernote and URL actions for it. Not only that, I keep it as a notes repository, storing snippets that I will never &lt;em&gt;act on&lt;/em&gt;. Kind of like people use nvAlt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could choose to only use Drafts as a place to take actions on drafts, i.e., send text to other apps -- and use a Dropbox text editor for storing notes. The big changes that Greg Pierce (the developer) has in store look so enticing that it would be difficult for me &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to try it out on my iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>How to Add Twitter Card Support to Farg.io Blogs</title>
			<link>http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/09/18/howToAddTwitterCardSupportToFargioBlogs.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/wdqtukqaz5fhzyn/Screen%20Shot%202014-09-18%20at%202.48.42%20PM.png?dl=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.twitter.com/cards/getting-started&quot;&gt;Twitter cards&lt;/a&gt; show additional information associated with a link. Twitter draws this information from meta tags on your page. Twitter cards support the open graph protocol, so there are only two additional lines of code you would need to add to your site via my &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/09/12/fargoScriptToAddOpenGraphMetaTagsToYourBlogPost.html&quot;&gt;meta open graph script&lt;/a&gt; to support a basic summary card:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;meta &quot;twitter:card&quot; type=&quot;summary&quot; /&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;meta &quot;twitter:site&quot; type=&quot;@kishner&quot; /&amp;gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to incorporate the above meta tags, use the following updated &lt;code&gt;add meta og&lt;/code&gt; script. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Fargo scripting blog&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;%reader (&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/bad9q1si3jwftfl/78c0df1667494ee3d824a4b83800cb70.opml?dl=0&quot;)%&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you replace @kishner with your own Twitter handle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to having the meta tags on your page, you need to get your site whitelisted by Twitter. After you've published a post with the meta tags, enter your URL in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator&quot;&gt;Card Validator&lt;/a&gt;. If the card is valid but your site has not been approved, then submit for review. After your site has been approved, your Twitter cards will show up.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Test-Driving iOS 8 Before I Upgrade My iPhone</title>
			<link>http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/09/18/testdrivingIos8BeforeIUpgradeMyIphone.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;I've been debating whether I &lt;em&gt;absolutely have to&lt;/em&gt; get a new iPhone. If I do, I'd get the year-old 5s. But for a 32gb model, that's $150 plus a $40 activation fee to renew my 2-yr contract on AT&amp;amp;T, unless I go with their Next plan. I haven't done the math, but it appears that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/16/4528404/att-next-phone-upgrade-plans-a-huge-ripoff&quot;&gt;the Next plan is a ripoff&lt;/a&gt;, so I'd be paying close to $200 for a subsidized iPhone 5s. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, when iOS 8 was released, I decided to install it on my iPad mini. Although the new OS can technically be installed on a 4s, I've read that the animations are choppy, and I already find the iOS 7 animations on my 4s to be slow. I am test-driving the new versions of my favorite productivity apps in iOS 8 to see if I can live without them on my iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, I've clipped an article in Safari to Evernote using the app's extension, and I've signed in to Pinner for Pinboard using the 1Password extension. The Evernote extension functionality is a big plus compared to using Everclip or a javascript bookmarklet or &lt;a href=&quot;http://philgr.com/blog/save-articles-from-the-web-on-evernote-from-ios&quot;&gt;this novel solution by Phillip Gruneich&lt;/a&gt;. I haven't tested out the Instapaper extension yet, and I'm looking forward to trying the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/agiletortoise/044d3f20b3f1a94aa2f7&quot;&gt;new version of Drafts coming out in October&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do most of my &quot;consumption&quot; on the iPad anyway, so saving articles to Evernote or Instapaper would happen there. I use my iPhone mainly for task management and brain-dumping; &quot;Launch Center Pro&quot; and Drafts are the killer apps for me there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My conscience is telling me to use my iPhone 4s until it is pretty much nonfunctional. It seems wasteful otherwise. Yes, I can upgrade to a 5s and hand my old phone down as an iPod Touch to a family member, but I'm still spending good money for a new product. And any new product uses up resources and has a labor cost as well. &lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Fargo Script to Add Open Graph Meta Tags to Your Blog Post</title>
			<link>http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/09/12/fargoScriptToAddOpenGraphMetaTagsToYourBlogPost.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;The following Fargo.io script will insert a &amp;num;glossary directive followed by a customStylesScripts macro that includes open graph meta tags for title, url, and description. I have tested this in Google's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets&quot;&gt;Structured Data Testing Tool&lt;/a&gt; and Facebook's &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/og/object/&quot;&gt;Open Graph Object Debugger&lt;/a&gt; and it works. With these tags in place, you should be able to post a Fargo blog post to Facebook and have the open graph meta tags properly parsed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make this work, you need to add the script below to your menubar.opml file. Write your blog post, then put the cursor on the title of the post, and choose the &lt;em&gt;add meta og&lt;/em&gt; script. Everything you need will be automatically written. By default, the description tag pulls the first line of your blog post. You can edit it afterwards if you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/o97r8euba97i24g/Screen%20Shot%202014-09-12%20at%203.28.38%20PM.png?dl=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Install Tiny Tiny RSS on Your Server Without Using the Command Line</title>
			<link>http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/09/11/installTinyTinyRssOnYourServerWithoutUsingTheCommandLine.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tt-rss.org/redmine/projects/tt-rss/wiki&quot;&gt;Tiny Tiny RSS&lt;/a&gt; is a open-source RSS reader that you can install on any LAMP server (Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP). I installed this yesterday and it wasn't too complicated. &lt;a href=&quot;http://lifehacker.com/5992404/how-to-build-your-own-syncing-rss-reader-with-tiny-tiny-rss-and-kick-google-reader-to-the-curb&quot;&gt;Lifehacker&lt;/a&gt; has a tutorial, but one doesn't need any Linux or command line experience to install this application. You &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; need to be comfortable with cPanel and FTP software. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-chevron-right&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Download the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gothfox/Tiny-Tiny-RSS/archive/1.13.tar.gz&quot;&gt;tar&lt;/a&gt; to your hard drive and extract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-chevron-right&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Open the Web Host Manager for your server, and go to the cPanel for the domain onto which you are installing the application. Then go to the MySQL Database Wizard. You will need to create a new database, a new user for that database, and create a password. Then give the user all privileges. Make sure you note these all down, and then you can sign out of your Web Host Manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-chevron-right&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Next, open FTP software (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://filezilla-project.org/&quot;&gt;Filezilla&lt;/a&gt;). Rename the folder that you extracted from the tar to &lt;em&gt;tt-rss&lt;/em&gt;, and upload the folder (and all of its contents) to the public_html directory of your domain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-chevron-right&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; After upload is complete, visit the install page at &lt;em&gt;http://YOUR-DOMAIN.com/tt-rss/install/&lt;/em&gt;. Enter the database settings you created in the MySQL wizard, and hit the test button. If it was a success, initialize the database. The app will provide you the contents of a custom config.php file. Copy this text and paste it into a new file in a text editor. Search for SIMPLE_UPDATE_MODE in the file and change its value to &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; so that the feeds will update every 1/2 hour while you're using the app. Save the file as config.php and upload into the &lt;em&gt;tt-rss&lt;/em&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-chevron-right&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Now you can go visit /tt-rss/ and log in initially with &lt;code&gt;admin&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;password&lt;/code&gt;. You can go into preferences to change the admin password, create users, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Resources&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>But Do I Need It?</title>
			<link>http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/09/10/butDoINeedIt.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;Had a talk with my wife last night about the Apple event. She does not follow Apple news. She uses one of my old iPhones as an iPod Touch to play Letterpress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told her I wanted to upgrade to the 5s (which is a year old), and she asked, &quot;But do you &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; it?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That fact is, I &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt;. My 4s works fine with iOS 7. The screen isn't cracked, I can make calls, the battery life is acceptable. I don't even want new hardware, I just want a phone that will work well with iOS 8, and I fear that my 4s won't cut it. Some of the iOS 7 animation effects are already kind of sluggish on my current phone, and god knows how many apps I'd have to delete just to be able to install iOS 8 on it, given that I am constantly getting &quot;you have no more storage left&quot; messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told her I just like to play with productivity apps, it appeals to my geeky side. But is it worth it to spend even $150 just so I can perform actions in Notification Center, or use 1Password from within a supported app?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Next New Thing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a history of always buying The Next New Thing, debt be damned. After twenty years or so of adulthood, I am working on being less impetuous. My wife is from Germany, and she reminds me -- often -- that German companies make products to last, and that companies take their products back from consumers when they are no longer functioning. Here in the U.S., &lt;em&gt;planned obsolescence&lt;/em&gt; seems to be the rule rather than the exception. Also, there is something to be said for thinking about the environment. Apple's green record is improving, but if I upgrade my phone every two years even if it is working fine, in some sense I am needlessly supporting the extraction of more precious metals, and I am probably contributing to the Chinese factory worker problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that I definitely won't upgrade this Fall, but the thought of doing so doesn't sit well with me. I may wait the release of iOS 8 out, and observe how much pain&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; I endure when my favorite apps integrate iOS 8-only features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; This is the Fear of Missing Out (FOMA) pain of a geek who enjoys using Drafts, Launch Center Pro, Pythonista, etc. How would I feel reading blogs and not being able to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; what the authors outline in their URL schemes/scripts/actions?&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Who Needs a Podcasting App?</title>
			<link>http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/09/10/whoNeedsAPodcastingApp.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;The problem I have with most podcasting apps is that they assume I want to always download the most recent episodes of podcasts to which I am subscribed. I would prefer to only download episodes to which I actually want to listen. After getting frustrated tweaking settings in apps like Instacast and Overcast, I've resorted to the following routine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Review the Podcasts Tab in River4&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/river4&quot;&gt;River4&lt;/a&gt; shows podcast enclosures. I can quickly scan the podcasts in &lt;a href=&quot;http://river.jeffreykishner.com/?panel=podcasts&quot;&gt;my river&lt;/a&gt; and decide what I want to listen to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/ugbukvz0g59t2j2/Screen%20Shot%202014-09-10%20at%2010.03.10%20AM.png?dl=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then right click on the mp3 link and copy the link location to my clipboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Send the Link to My iPhone&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://pushbullet.com&quot;&gt;Pushbullet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pushbullet/chlffgpmiacpedhhbkiomidkjlcfhogd?hl=en&quot;&gt;Chrome extension&lt;/a&gt;, I send the link to my iPhone. I just make sure to precede the link with a &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; (explanation below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/i66est3qfzosbf7/Screen%20Shot%202014-09-10%20at%2010.06.11%20AM.png?dl=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I receive the push notification (the Pushbullet app on the iPhone is of course required), I swipe on it, and the link immediately opens to...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Download in GoodReader&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goodiware.com/&quot;&gt;GoodReader&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent app for downloading just about any media: mp3s, movie files, images, html files, PDFs. When an URL is preceded by a &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt;, it tells Safari to go to GoodReader, and then GoodReader downloads the file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This app remembers where I leave off in the middle of listening to a podcast -- although I have to hit the &quot;Stop&quot; button after pausing the recording -- so I can easily resume the podcast just by tapping on the filename. When I'm done, I swipe to delete.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Time to Upgrade</title>
			<link>http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/09/09/timeToUpgrade.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;I have a 16 gb iPhone 4s. I am constantly hitting my memory limits, and I fear that the phone will run sluggishly if I install iOS 8. After following today's Apple event, I am thinking of just getting a 32 gb 5s for $149. As much as I'd love a 6, knowing that 16 gb is not enough I'd have to get a 64 gb model, which costs $299. (And that's with a renewed 2-year contract!) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I could choose to do nothing, but I really want iOS 8. I am, after all, a major iPhone geek, and I want Extensions and Handoff. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm much more interested in the latest software than the latest hardware, but I feel I have to invest in more recent hardware to get the best out of the latest iOS update, and I think the 5s will be fine for my needs.&lt;/p&gt;
