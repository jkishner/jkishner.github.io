			<title>CloudKit Dammit!</title>
			<link>http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/09/18/cloudkitDammit.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;I just learned that the new version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/&quot;&gt;Drafts&lt;/a&gt; will be using CloudKit and will drop Simperium sync. So &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/09/18/testdrivingIos8BeforeIUpgradeMyIphone.html&quot;&gt;if I choose not to upgrade my iPhone&lt;/a&gt; and want to try the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/agiletortoise/044d3f20b3f1a94aa2f7&quot;&gt;iOS-8-only version of Drafts&lt;/a&gt; on my iPad, I will not be able to sync my drafts between the two devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/kishner&quot;&gt;@kishner&lt;/a&gt; Yes. Using CloudKit for sync.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/kishner&quot;&gt;@kishner&lt;/a&gt; You will have to stay on the current version (which works fine on 8).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use Drafts pretty much daily, and I have written God knows how many Dropbox, Evernote and URL actions for it. Not only that, I keep it as a notes repository, storing snippets that I will never &lt;em&gt;act on&lt;/em&gt;. Kind of like people use nvAlt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could choose to only use Drafts as a place to take actions on drafts, i.e., send text to other apps -- and use a Dropbox text editor for storing notes. The big changes that Greg Pierce (the developer) has in store look so enticing that it would be difficult for me &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to try it out on my iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>How to Add Twitter Card Support to Farg.io Blogs</title>
			<link>http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/09/18/howToAddTwitterCardSupportToFargioBlogs.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/wdqtukqaz5fhzyn/Screen%20Shot%202014-09-18%20at%202.48.42%20PM.png?dl=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.twitter.com/cards/getting-started&quot;&gt;Twitter cards&lt;/a&gt; show additional information associated with a link. Twitter draws this information from meta tags on your page. Twitter cards support the open graph protocol, so there are only two additional lines of code you would need to add to your site via my &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/09/12/fargoScriptToAddOpenGraphMetaTagsToYourBlogPost.html&quot;&gt;meta open graph script&lt;/a&gt; to support a basic summary card:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;meta &quot;twitter:card&quot; type=&quot;summary&quot; /&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;meta &quot;twitter:site&quot; type=&quot;@kishner&quot; /&amp;gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to incorporate the above meta tags, use the following updated &lt;code&gt;add meta og&lt;/code&gt; script. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.fargo.io/fargoScripting&quot;&gt;Fargo scripting page in the docs&lt;/a&gt; to learn how to install this script, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DG9vpDsTv4A&quot;&gt;watch this video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;%reader (&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/bad9q1si3jwftfl/78c0df1667494ee3d824a4b83800cb70.opml?dl=0&quot;)%&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you replace @kishner with your own Twitter handle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to having the meta tags on your page, you need to get your site whitelisted by Twitter. After you've published a post with the meta tags, enter your URL in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator&quot;&gt;Card Validator&lt;/a&gt;. If the card is valid but your site has not been approved, then submit for review. After your site has been approved, your Twitter cards will show up.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Test-Driving iOS 8 Before I Upgrade My iPhone</title>
			<link>http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/09/18/testdrivingIos8BeforeIUpgradeMyIphone.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;I've been debating whether I &lt;em&gt;absolutely have to&lt;/em&gt; get a new iPhone. If I do, I'd get the year-old 5s. But for a 32gb model, that's $150 plus a $40 activation fee to renew my 2-yr contract on AT&amp;amp;T, unless I go with their Next plan. I haven't done the math, but it appears that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/16/4528404/att-next-phone-upgrade-plans-a-huge-ripoff&quot;&gt;the Next plan is a ripoff&lt;/a&gt;, so I'd be paying close to $200 for a subsidized iPhone 5s. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, when iOS 8 was released, I decided to install it on my iPad mini. Although the new OS can technically be installed on a 4s, I've read that the animations are choppy, and I already find the iOS 7 animations on my 4s to be slow. I am test-driving the new versions of my favorite productivity apps in iOS 8 to see if I can live without them on my iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, I've clipped an article in Safari to Evernote using the app's extension, and I've signed in to Pinner for Pinboard using the 1Password extension. The Evernote extension functionality is a big plus compared to using Everclip or a javascript bookmarklet or &lt;a href=&quot;http://philgr.com/blog/save-articles-from-the-web-on-evernote-from-ios&quot;&gt;this novel solution by Phillip Gruneich&lt;/a&gt;. I haven't tested out the Instapaper extension yet, and I'm looking forward to trying the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/agiletortoise/044d3f20b3f1a94aa2f7&quot;&gt;new version of Drafts coming out in October&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do most of my &quot;consumption&quot; on the iPad anyway, so saving articles to Evernote or Instapaper would happen there. I use my iPhone mainly for task management and brain-dumping; &lt;a href=&quot;http://contrast.co/launch-center-pro/&quot;&gt;Launch Center Pro&lt;/a&gt; and Drafts are the killer apps for me there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My conscience is telling me to use my iPhone 4s until it is pretty much nonfunctional. It seems wasteful otherwise. Yes, I can upgrade to a 5s and hand my old phone down as an iPod Touch to a family member, but I'm still spending good money for a new product. And any new product uses up resources and has a labor cost as well. &lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Fargo Script to Add Open Graph Meta Tags to Your Blog Post</title>
			<link>http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/09/12/fargoScriptToAddOpenGraphMetaTagsToYourBlogPost.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;The following Fargo.io script will insert a &amp;num;glossary directive followed by a customStylesScripts macro that includes open graph meta tags for title, url, and description. I have tested this in Google's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets&quot;&gt;Structured Data Testing Tool&lt;/a&gt; and Facebook's &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/og/object/&quot;&gt;Open Graph Object Debugger&lt;/a&gt; and it works. With these tags in place, you should be able to post a Fargo blog post to Facebook and have the open graph meta tags properly parsed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make this work, you need to add the script below to your menubar.opml file. Write your blog post, then put the cursor on the title of the post, and choose the &lt;em&gt;add meta og&lt;/em&gt; script. Everything you need will be automatically written. By default, the description tag pulls the first line of your blog post. You can edit it afterwards if you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/o97r8euba97i24g/Screen%20Shot%202014-09-12%20at%203.28.38%20PM.png?dl=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.fargo.io/fargoScripting&quot;&gt;Fargo scripting page in the docs&lt;/a&gt; to learn how to install this script, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DG9vpDsTv4A&quot;&gt;watch this video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Install Tiny Tiny RSS on Your Server Without Using the Command Line</title>
			<link>http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/09/11/installTinyTinyRssOnYourServerWithoutUsingTheCommandLine.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tt-rss.org/redmine/projects/tt-rss/wiki&quot;&gt;Tiny Tiny RSS&lt;/a&gt; is a open-source RSS reader that you can install on any LAMP server (Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP). I installed this yesterday and it wasn't too complicated. &lt;a href=&quot;http://lifehacker.com/5992404/how-to-build-your-own-syncing-rss-reader-with-tiny-tiny-rss-and-kick-google-reader-to-the-curb&quot;&gt;Lifehacker&lt;/a&gt; has a tutorial, but one doesn't need any Linux or command line experience to install this application. You &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; need to be comfortable with cPanel and FTP software. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-chevron-right&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Download the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gothfox/Tiny-Tiny-RSS/archive/1.13.tar.gz&quot;&gt;tar&lt;/a&gt; to your hard drive and extract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-chevron-right&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Open the Web Host Manager for your server, and go to the cPanel for the domain onto which you are installing the application. Then go to the MySQL Database Wizard. You will need to create a new database, a new user for that database, and create a password. Then give the user all privileges. Make sure you note these all down, and then you can sign out of your Web Host Manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-chevron-right&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Next, open FTP software (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://filezilla-project.org/&quot;&gt;Filezilla&lt;/a&gt;). Rename the folder that you extracted from the tar to &lt;em&gt;tt-rss&lt;/em&gt;, and upload the folder (and all of its contents) to the public_html directory of your domain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-chevron-right&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; After upload is complete, visit the install page at &lt;em&gt;http://YOUR-DOMAIN.com/tt-rss/install/&lt;/em&gt;. Enter the database settings you created in the MySQL wizard, and hit the test button. If it was a success, initialize the database. The app will provide you the contents of a custom config.php file. Copy this text and paste it into a new file in a text editor. Search for SIMPLE_UPDATE_MODE in the file and change its value to &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; so that the feeds will update every 1/2 hour while you're using the app. Save the file as config.php and upload into the &lt;em&gt;tt-rss&lt;/em&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-chevron-right&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Now you can go visit /tt-rss/ and log in initially with &lt;code&gt;admin&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;password&lt;/code&gt;. You can go into preferences to change the admin password, create users, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Resources&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tt-rss.org/redmine/projects/tt-rss/wiki/InstallationNotes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Installation Notes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>But Do I Need It?</title>
			<link>http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/09/10/butDoINeedIt.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;Had a talk with my wife last night about the Apple event. She does not follow Apple news. She uses one of my old iPhones as an iPod Touch to play Letterpress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told her I wanted to upgrade to the 5s (which is a year old), and she asked, &quot;But do you &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; it?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That fact is, I &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt;. My 4s works fine with iOS 7. The screen isn't cracked, I can make calls, the battery life is acceptable. I don't even want new hardware, I just want a phone that will work well with iOS 8, and I fear that my 4s won't cut it. Some of the iOS 7 animation effects are already kind of sluggish on my current phone, and god knows how many apps I'd have to delete just to be able to install iOS 8 on it, given that I am constantly getting &quot;you have no more storage left&quot; messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told her I just like to play with productivity apps, it appeals to my geeky side. But is it worth it to spend even $150 just so I can perform actions in Notification Center, or use 1Password from within a supported app?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Next New Thing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a history of always buying The Next New Thing, debt be damned. After twenty years or so of adulthood, I am working on being less impetuous. My wife is from Germany, and she reminds me -- often -- that German companies make products to last, and that companies take their products back from consumers when they are no longer functioning. Here in the U.S., &lt;em&gt;planned obsolescence&lt;/em&gt; seems to be the rule rather than the exception. Also, there is something to be said for thinking about the environment. Apple's green record is improving, but if I upgrade my phone every two years even if it is working fine, in some sense I am needlessly supporting the extraction of more precious metals, and I am probably contributing to the Chinese factory worker problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that I definitely won't upgrade this Fall, but the thought of doing so doesn't sit well with me. I may wait the release of iOS 8 out, and observe how much pain&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; I endure when my favorite apps integrate iOS 8-only features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; This is the Fear of Missing Out (FOMA) pain of a geek who enjoys using Drafts, Launch Center Pro, Pythonista, etc. How would I feel reading blogs and not being able to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; what the authors outline in their URL schemes/scripts/actions?&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Who Needs a Podcasting App?</title>
			<link>http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/09/10/whoNeedsAPodcastingApp.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;The problem I have with most podcasting apps is that they assume I want to always download the most recent episodes of podcasts to which I am subscribed. I would prefer to only download episodes to which I actually want to listen. After getting frustrated tweaking settings in apps like Instacast and Overcast, I've resorted to the following routine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Review the Podcasts Tab in River4&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/river4&quot;&gt;River4&lt;/a&gt; shows podcast enclosures. I can quickly scan the podcasts in &lt;a href=&quot;http://river.jeffreykishner.com/?panel=podcasts&quot;&gt;my river&lt;/a&gt; and decide what I want to listen to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/ugbukvz0g59t2j2/Screen%20Shot%202014-09-10%20at%2010.03.10%20AM.png?dl=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then right click on the mp3 link and copy the link location to my clipboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Send the Link to My iPhone&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://pushbullet.com&quot;&gt;Pushbullet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pushbullet/chlffgpmiacpedhhbkiomidkjlcfhogd?hl=en&quot;&gt;Chrome extension&lt;/a&gt;, I send the link to my iPhone. I just make sure to precede the link with a &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; (explanation below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/i66est3qfzosbf7/Screen%20Shot%202014-09-10%20at%2010.06.11%20AM.png?dl=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I receive the push notification (the Pushbullet app on the iPhone is of course required), I swipe on it, and the link immediately opens to...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Download in GoodReader&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goodiware.com/&quot;&gt;GoodReader&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent app for downloading just about any media: mp3s, movie files, images, html files, PDFs. When an URL is preceded by a &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt;, it tells Safari to go to GoodReader, and then GoodReader downloads the file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This app remembers where I leave off in the middle of listening to a podcast -- although I have to hit the &quot;Stop&quot; button after pausing the recording -- so I can easily resume the podcast just by tapping on the filename. When I'm done, I swipe to delete.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Time to Upgrade</title>
			<link>http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/09/09/timeToUpgrade.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;I have a 16 gb iPhone 4s. I am constantly hitting my memory limits, and I fear that the phone will run sluggishly if I install iOS 8. After following today's Apple event, I am thinking of just getting a 32 gb 5s for $149. As much as I'd love a 6, knowing that 16 gb is not enough I'd have to get a 64 gb model, which costs $299. (And that's with a renewed 2-year contract!) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I could choose to do nothing, but I really want iOS 8. I am, after all, a major iPhone geek, and I want Extensions and Handoff. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm much more interested in the latest software than the latest hardware, but I feel I have to invest in more recent hardware to get the best out of the latest iOS update, and I think the 5s will be fine for my needs.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>The Cost of River4</title>
			<link>http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/09/03/theCostOfRiver4.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;I just got my Amazon Web Services bill. It looks like the portion of it attributable to running River4 for August was a little over ten dollars. I know this is not backbreaking, but it's not free either. It's more expensive than a paid account at Newsblur or Feedly. And I'm already running &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedafever.com&quot;&gt;Fever&lt;/a&gt; on my VPS for no extra cost. Right now I'm &lt;em&gt;liking&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://river.jeffreykishner.com&quot;&gt;my river&lt;/a&gt; but the cost of the Amazon bandwidth and service requests are higher than I had anticipated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember going through a similar experience when I was running &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2013/09/06/isPayingForAnAmazonEc2InstanceToRunRiver23WorthIt.html&quot;&gt;River2 and River3&lt;/a&gt;. At that time, the big cost was running the EC2 instance 24/7. With River4, I'm running the software on my VPS, so it's not costing me anything extra. It's all Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Posting Multiple Sites with fargoPublisher on Heroku REDUX</title>
			<link>http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/09/03/postingMultipleSitesWithFargopublisherOnHerokuRedux.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/09/02/postingMultipleSitesWithFargopublisherOnHeroku.html&quot;&gt;Yesterday&lt;/a&gt; I blogged about fargoPublisher and Heroku but I got pretty much everything &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;. Thanks to clarification from Dave Winer on the Fargo2 Google group, I finally got fargoPublisher working as intended. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, follow Dave's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/02/06/herokuForPoetsBeta.html&quot;&gt;Heroku for Poets tutorial&lt;/a&gt;. I created a Heroku app, and put the domain name of that app in the CMS settings in Fargo (at the top right, where your name is), e.g., app.herokuapp.com (not the real app name).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I registered the domain myblogoutline.com. And created an Amazon S3 bucket called myblogoutline.com (although I think you can call the bucket whatever you want, it doesn't have to coincide with the domain name). At my domain registrar, I have a wildcard CNAME (&quot;*&quot;) pointing to app.herokuapp.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Heroku dashboard for my app, under domains, it shows the name of my app. I added to it *.myoutlineblog.com. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have the following set up as config variables on the same settings page (minus the Amazon secret keys):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;fpDataPath = /myblogoutline.com/data/

fpDomain = myblogoutline.com

fpHostingPath = /myblogoutline.com/users/

fpRedirect = false

fpServerPort = 80
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then created a new outline in Fargo, named it (File &gt; Name Outline...) and added a few entries. When I put the cursor on a headline and clicked on the eye icon in the left rail, Fargo successfully opened the correct URL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I understand from Dave, Heroku does all the serving of content, Amazon just &lt;em&gt;stores&lt;/em&gt; the data.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Posting Multiple Sites with fargoPublisher on Heroku</title>
			<link>http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/09/02/postingMultipleSitesWithFargopublisherOnHeroku.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please disregard the content below and go &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/09/03/postingMultipleSitesWithFargopublisherOnHerokuRedux.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have managed to successfully deploy &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/fargoPublisher&quot;&gt;fargoPublisher&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://heroku.com&quot;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/02/06/herokuForPoetsBeta.html&quot;&gt;Dave Winer's instructions&lt;/a&gt;. It was surprisingly easy. (The only snag was that I had to put &lt;em&gt;*&lt;/em&gt;*.herokuapp.com in the CMS settings globally, not per individual outline.) The difficult part has been figuring out how to actually publish the sites. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;fargoPublisher seems to essentially be the same software used to create subdomains on smallpict.com. If you want to publish one of your outlines on your own Amazon S3 bucket, you need to &quot;name&quot; it. As of this writing, my Heroku app is publishing to a bucket called myoutlineblog.com (same as a domain name I registered). Theoretically, if I name an outline &quot;blog,&quot; it will publish at blog.myoutlineblog.com. However, there are two separate DNS components necessary to make this work. First I need to point myoutlineblog.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com (the &quot;endpoint&quot;) to myoutlineblog.com via CNAME. And to the best of my knowledge, I need to point a wildcard A record to the IP address of the node where I am hosting fargoPublisher. This is where the users are redirected to their subdomains. Unfortunately, Heroku apps only have dynamic IP addresses, and I don't currently see a solution to this, so I can only access my example named site at myoutlineblog.com/users/blog/, not blog.myoutlineblog.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is problematic because links in Fargo sites are relative, e.g, &lt;code&gt;&quot;href=2014/09/01/blogpost.html&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, and named outlines have the blog.domain.com structure. One workaround is adding a few directives in the outline: &lt;code&gt;#opmlLink &quot;http://myoutlineblog.com/users/blog/&quot;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;#opmlFeed &quot;http://myoutlineblog.com/users/blog/rss.xml&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This appears to successfully replace blog.myoutlineblog.com with myoutlineblog.com/users/blog/ in the rendered HTML, so that if I click on a link to a post from an index.html page, I will be directed to the correct path. Unfortunately, this solution is not working for #type &quot;stream&quot; blogs (i.e., link or note blogs like scripting.com). I believe that since you can only click on a date, Fargo is expecting the base domain, no additional directories. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another problem is that the RSS feed points to the blog.domain.com address, so unless I can figure out how to fix that, any feed subscribers clicking on a feed item will be directed to a 404 page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As currently implemented, this solution is definitely better than not having fargoPublisher deployed at all. I can publish all the outlines I want to my own AWS account. I just have to tweak every outline a bit to make relative links work, and I guess stream blogs are out of the question until I can find a workaround.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Workflowy vs. Fargo</title>
			<link>http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/08/18/workflowyVsFargo.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;I've been occasionally using &lt;a href=&quot;http://workflowy.com&quot;&gt;Workflowy&lt;/a&gt; simply because &quot;Fargo&quot; does not have a native iOS app, and its web app is barely serviceable: I need to close most tabs to increase responsiveness, and even with the arrow pad, writing and editing on the iPad or iPhone in Fargo is frustrating. Only Workflowy has an iOS app, and it works well.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Fargo is far-and-away a superior product on the desktop. Just a few of the things I can do in Fargo that I can't in Workflowy:&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Publish a blog.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Add attributes other than &lt;i&gt;_note&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Run scripts.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Sharing an outline is possible from both apps.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;In Fargo, I can share the public Dropbox URL of an outline, and a reader can import that into Fargo or view it in something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://reader.smallpicture.com/&quot;&gt;Small Picture Reader&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;In Workflowy, I can share any outline via a secret link, and even make it editable.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Both have pretty good keyboard shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Importing and Exporting OPML&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;I can copy the full text from an OPML file in my Dropbox account (where Fargo stores outlines) and paste it into Workflowy, and Workflowy will respect the hierarchy (although not import unsupported attributes). I can also export any outline in Workflow as OPML.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;This Fargo script allows me to import OPML into an outline:&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;ul&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;add opml in dialog box (workflowy)&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;ul&gt;
							&lt;li&gt;dialog.ask (&quot;paste raw opml here&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, function (data) {&lt;/li&gt;
							&lt;ul&gt;
								&lt;li&gt;op.insertOpml (data, down);&lt;/li&gt;
								&lt;li&gt;});&lt;/li&gt;
								&lt;/ul&gt;
							&lt;/ul&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;&quot;Fargo scripting blog&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;Just paste the OPML from Workflowy into the dialog box, hit Enter, and the outline will import into your current tab in Fargo.&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;/ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;You can also just import plain text into Fargo, because the app recognizes hard tabs as child nodes.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;

			<title>Customize Your River4 Home Page to Send Links to Instapaper</title>
			<link>http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/08/14/customizeYourRiver4HomePageToSendLinksToInstapaper.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;I've added two lines of code to &lt;a href=&quot;http://river.jeffreykishner.com&quot;&gt;my River4 homepage&lt;/a&gt; to let me send a link in the river to Instapaper, or to read the post on a clean page using the Instapaper parsing engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/xz7r7cly19nemun/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-14%20at%2010.26.23%20AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How to Add This to Your River&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you've installed River4 (available on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/river4&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;), you will need to grab the HTML of the &lt;em&gt;index.html&lt;/em&gt; file in your Amazon S3 bucket. Open it in a text file, and add these two lines of code immediately after &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;class=&quot;actions&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;{{if item.permaLink}}${'http://instapaper.com/edit?url='+item.permaLink}{{else}}${'http://instapaper.com/edit?url='+item.link}{{/if}}&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&amp;gt;Send to Instapaper&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

			<title>River 4</title>

			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;I got Dave Winer's &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/river4&quot;&gt;River 4&lt;/a&gt; to work on my Linux VPS. You can see it &lt;a href=&quot;http://river.jeffreykishner.com&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know next to nothing about node.js; I managed to install it, as well as &lt;em&gt;npm&lt;/em&gt; and an app called &lt;em&gt;forever&lt;/em&gt; that will run river.js in the background. (Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriven.chrisdadswell.co.uk/articles/howToSetupAFargoRiverOfNews.html&quot;&gt;Chris Dadswell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.andrewshell.org/running-river4-with-forever/&quot;&gt;Andrew Shell&lt;/a&gt; for their blog posts about this.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know enough to install apps in Linux, grab the above, clone river 4 via git, and run &lt;code&gt;node river.js&lt;/code&gt; from within the river4 folder. If everything works, you can run &lt;code&gt;forever start river.js&lt;/code&gt; in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, the hardest part was getting my Amazon S3 bucket to work. I learned via Stack Overflow that in order to map river.jeffreykishner.com via CNAME to my bucket, I had to name the &lt;em&gt;bucket&lt;/em&gt; river.jeffreykishner.com. That was the only major hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also learned that I needed to store the three environmental variables in .bashrc so that they would stay permanent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cool thing about River 4 is that one can &lt;a href=&quot;http://river4.smallpict.com/2014/06/17/river4V088.html&quot;&gt;use &lt;em&gt;include&lt;/em&gt; to reference an OPML file that is not stored in your S3 bucket&lt;/a&gt;. As an experiment, I uploaded an OPML file that includes a link to an OPML file hosted in &lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io&quot;&gt;Fargo&lt;/a&gt;. Sure enough, the feeds in the OPML file in Fargo appear in my river, so in the future, all I have to do is add a new feed to my list in Fargo instead of having to re-upload an OPML file to Amazon everytime I want to add a new feed to a tab. &lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Command Line Script to Make Your iPhone Dial a Number</title>
			<link>http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/07/24/commandLineScriptToMakeYourIphoneDialANumber.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;This is a bash script that only requires a single command in Terminal and a single swipe on your iPhone to make a phone call. It is an adaptation of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/05/23/sendTextAndAnActionToDraftsForIosFromTheCommandLine.html&quot;&gt;command line Pushover script&lt;/a&gt;, so please review that before proceeding below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a file called &lt;code&gt;callhome&lt;/code&gt; at /usr/local/bin with the following contents:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#! /bin/bash

message=&quot;tel:8005551212&quot;

action=&quot;Call Home&quot;

url_title=&quot;Make the Call&quot;

curl -s \

  -F &quot;token=$APP_TOKEN&quot; \

  -F &quot;user=$USER_KEY&quot; \

  -F &quot;title=$action&quot; \

  -F &quot;message=$message&quot; \

  -F &quot;url_title=$url_title&quot; \

  -F &quot;url=tel:8005551212&quot; \

  https://api.pushover.net/1/messages.json
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replace the two instances of &lt;code&gt;8005551212&lt;/code&gt; with a phone number, and $APP_TOKEN and $USER_KEY with your app token and user key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make the script executable: &lt;code&gt;chmod +x callhome&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now all you have to do is type &lt;code&gt;callhome&lt;/code&gt; from the command line. When you get a notification on your iPhone, swipe it. Pushover will open the supplementary URL, which will dial the number.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Pushbullet: Communicate Between Your Phone and Your Computer (As Long as You Live in GoogleLand)</title>
			<link>http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/07/11/pushbulletCommunicateBetweenYourPhoneAndYourComputerAsLongAsYouLiveInGoogleland.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pushbullet.com/#&quot;&gt;Pushbullet&lt;/a&gt; is the best service I've seen so far that will allow me to push info from my phone to my work computer and vice versa. (I cannot install &lt;a href=&quot;http://danilo.to/command-c&quot;&gt;Command-C&lt;/a&gt; at the office.) I installed the Chrome extension and the iPhone app. From the Chrome extension, I can push a note or a list to the iOS app. This in itself is unremarkable -- I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://pushover.net/&quot;&gt;Pushover&lt;/a&gt; all the time for that. But the killer feature is that I can send a link to my phone, and the moment I swipe the notification, that URL will open in the Chrome browser. And if I send an address to my iPhone, after I swipe the notification Google Maps will open to that location.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I can quickly send the clipboard contents on my iPhone to the desktop extension. This is a lot faster than emailing text to myself or uploading it to Dropbox via &lt;a href=&quot;http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/&quot;&gt;Drafts&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://contrast.co/launch-center-pro/&quot;&gt;Launch Center Pro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;IFTTT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's an &lt;a href=&quot;https://ifttt.com/pushbullet&quot;&gt;IFTTT channel&lt;/a&gt; that allows you to push a note, link, file or address to your iPhone. I haven't played around with this, but there are many shared recipes for the channel, and I imagine you can create a recipe to automatically send images from a feed to your device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;URL Schemes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pushbullet has &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.pushbullet.com/iphone/&quot;&gt;URL schemes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bachyaproductions.com/ios-url-actions-the-up-to-date-guide/&quot;&gt;Bachya&lt;/a&gt; wrote this bookmarklet to send the current page in your iOS web browser to the Pushbullet app:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;javascript:window.location='pushbullet://compose?type=link&amp;amp;title=' + encodeURIComponent(document.title) + '&amp;amp;url=' + encodeURIComponent(window.location)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Only Downside: Google&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been working to become less reliant on Google -- for example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2013/08/22/anotherPersonMovingToFastmailfm.html&quot;&gt;moving to Fastmail.fm&lt;/a&gt;. With Pushbullet, you can only sign in with Google, and you have no choice but to open links and addresses in Google Chrome and Google Maps. Granted, their iOS maps app is my default, and I use Chrome for Mac at work, but I still would prefer to have a &lt;em&gt;choice&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Pushbullet vs. Pushover&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been using my &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/05/23/sendTextAndAnActionToDraftsForIosFromTheCommandLine.html&quot;&gt;Pushover command line script&lt;/a&gt; to send text to my phone, and after a recent release, now a swipe of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pushover.net/&quot;&gt;Pushover&lt;/a&gt; notification will open a supplementary URL (if available). This is great, because I can execute Drafts actions with a swipe of a notification. For example I can make my message an URL and the Drafts action &quot;launch url&quot; (which is just &lt;code&gt;launch://?url=[[draft]]&lt;/code&gt;). This will open a link in Safari for iOS with a single swipe. However, it is definitely less work for me to just open the Pushbullet extension and send a link to my phone that way.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will continue to use my Pushover script to execute actions in Drafts, but Pushbullet is more convenient if I just want to quickly send text or a link to my phone.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Three Types of Lists</title>
			<link>http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/07/11/threeTypesOfLists.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;I am constantly fidgeting with my productivity apps and system. I was engaged to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crushapps.com/paperless/&quot;&gt;Paperless&lt;/a&gt; for many months, but now I am playing with &lt;a href=&quot;http://todotxt.com/&quot;&gt;Todo.txt&lt;/a&gt; on the command line and on iOS. As a result, I've been thinking about types of lists and the most appropriate apps for each type of list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Actionable Tasks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These lists include only tasks that require a physical (measurable/observable) action to mark as complete. This is what the GTD system is all about. Over the years I have used Omnifocus, TaskPaper, Paperless, and now Todo.txt. I have found that -- for me -- text-file-based apps are the best (TaskPaper, Todo.txt). They both support tags/contexts (the @ sign) and projects (the + sign in Todo.txt; a string followed by a : for TaskPaper). I can open them in any text editor, or I can manipulate the text in supported apps. (Jesse Grosjean removed his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper&quot;&gt;TaskPaper&lt;/a&gt; app from the iOS App Store, but fortunately Ole Zorn created an excellent TaskPaper module for &lt;a href=&quot;http://omz-software.com/editorial/&quot;&gt;Editorial&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;1a. Actionable Tasks With &quot;Hard&quot; Due Dates&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some actionable tasks need to be done at a very specific time, or &lt;em&gt;by&lt;/em&gt; a very specific time. &quot;Mail the DVD at 8:30am&quot; or &quot;Go to Trader Joe's at 6pm.&quot; These I put in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dueapp.com/&quot;&gt;Due&lt;/a&gt; or Fantastical/iOS Reminders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. &quot;Consumption&quot; Lists&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are items that I want to consume: books, movies, music tracks, groceries. None of this is urgent (well, except for food). These items do require checkboxes, because once I've rented/downloaded/borrowed/purchased the item, I don't need to do it again (... except for food).  I am still using Paperless for this, because the app provides a note field where I can include all the meta info I need (URLs, for example, or who suggested a particular book). And in Paperless, I can uncheck a grocery item to re-add it to my shopping list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Ideas Lists&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a list that is more-or-less called, &quot;Things I Need to Remember to Do at Home to Avoid the Wrath of My Wife.&quot; Another is &quot;Lunch Ideas.&quot; These items should not have checkboxes, because they are reference materials, not one-time (or even recurring) tasks. Right now I have these lists in &lt;a href=&quot;http://listaryapp.com/&quot;&gt;Listary&lt;/a&gt; which pulls notes with a specific tag from &lt;a href=&quot;http://simplenote.com/&quot;&gt;Simplenote&lt;/a&gt;. You can toggle a setting for a list in Paperless to remove checkboxes and just use the list as a reference. I have also used &lt;a href=&quot;http://carbonfin.com/&quot;&gt;Carbonfin Outliner&lt;/a&gt; with the checkboxes toggled off for these types of lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, one can store &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; these lists in simple text files and store them in a single directory. &lt;a href=&quot;http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/&quot;&gt;nvAlt&lt;/a&gt; fans do this. But am I either in front of my phone or a work computer, and I cannot sync Dropbox at work. (One can sync an nvAlt folder with Dropbox.) Although I feel too spread out with my various list apps, I do believe that the ultimate test is whether my system supports both &quot;brain dump&quot; and &quot;information access.&quot; Can I quickly note down an idea or todo? And can I easily find it later? Part of my problem is that I don't always recall where I put a todo. With this three-part categorical division, I hope I can better recall a todo's location. If it's actionable, it's in Todo.txt or iOS Reminders; if it's about something I want to buy, it's in Paperless; if it's an evergreen list, it's in Listary. We'll see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;I recently created an &lt;a href=&quot;http://ifttt.com&quot;&gt;IFTTT&lt;/a&gt; recipe to add the first url mentioned in a tweet to Instapaper if I favorite the tweet. Now I am concerned that someone will interpret my favorite as condoning the content of a tweet, whereas all it means is that I want to &quot;read it later.&quot; A favorite is not the equivalent of a &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-thumbs-o-up&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>2nd Update to My LCP Todo.txt Action: Now With Priorities</title>
			<link>http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/07/10/2ndUpdateToMyLcpTodotxtActionNowWithPriorities.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/kishner&quot;&gt;@kishner&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/LaunchCenterPro&quot;&gt;@LaunchCenterPro&lt;/a&gt; i also use prioritet: (A) for today, (B) for thisweek, (C) for someday and add promp for LCP&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newest version of my action (&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/1qrvQzVHUp&quot;&gt;import it into LCP&lt;/a&gt;) includes priorities A-C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;texttool://x-callback-url/transform?text=[list|clipboard=[clipboard]|prompt=[prompt-return:tasks]]&amp;amp;method=affix&amp;amp;prefix=[-list:priorities|A=%28A%29%20|B=%28B%29%20|C=%28C%29%20|none={{}}][textexpander:ddate]%20&amp;amp;suffix=[-list|no context={{}}|@online=%20%40online|contexts=%20%40[prompt-list( @)]][-list|no project={{}}|+Bills=%20%2BBills|projects=%20%2B[prompt-list( +)]]&amp;amp;scope=lines&amp;amp;x-success={{drafts:///create?text=[[output]]&amp;amp;action=todotxt}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now you can send something like the following to Drafts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(A) 2014-07-10 complete task @context +project
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://todotxt.com&quot;&gt;Todo.txt&lt;/a&gt; command line interface and the iPhone app. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/07/08/aLaunchCenterProActionForTodotxt.html&quot;&gt;first post in this series&lt;/a&gt; to get the Drafts Dropbox action, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/07/09/updateToLaunchCenterProActionToTodotxtMultipleContextsAndProjects.html&quot;&gt;the second one&lt;/a&gt; for more about the contexts and projects.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Update to Launch Center Pro Action to Todo.txt: Multiple Contexts and Projects</title>
			<link>http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/07/09/updateToLaunchCenterProActionToTodotxtMultipleContextsAndProjects.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/07/08/aLaunchCenterProActionForTodotxt.html&quot;&gt;Yesterday&lt;/a&gt; I posted a &lt;a href=&quot;http://contrast.co/launch-center-pro/&quot;&gt;Launch Center Pro&lt;/a&gt; action to prepend the date and append a single tag to all the items in a list, and then append that text to a file in Dropbox. Since then, I have been using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-cli&quot;&gt;todo.txt command line tool&lt;/a&gt; and decided to upgrade the action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This action lets you enter a task and then enter either (a) no tag (I prefer that to &quot;context&quot;); (b) a tag called &lt;code&gt;@online&lt;/code&gt;; (c) any number of tags; followed by (d) no project; (e) a project called &lt;code&gt;+bills&lt;/code&gt;; (f) any number of projects. To enter multiple tags or projects you need to hit Return after each, and then Next only when you're done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://launchcenterpro.com/z14cdz&quot;&gt;Import the new action&lt;/a&gt;. Or enter the following in the action composer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;texttool://x-callback-url/transform?text=[prompt-return:tasks]&amp;amp;method=affix&amp;amp;prefix=[textexpander:ddate]%20&amp;amp;suffix=[-list|no tag={{}}|@online=%20%40online|tag=%20%40[prompt-list( @)]][-list|no project={{}}|+Bills=%20%2BBills|project=%20%2B[prompt-list( +)]]&amp;amp;scope=lines&amp;amp;x-success={{drafts:///create?text=[[output]]&amp;amp;action=todotxt}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can decipher this action then you ought to be able to customize it, e.g., add &lt;code&gt;+work&lt;/code&gt; in the projects list.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>A Launch Center Pro Action for Todo.txt</title>
			<link>http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/07/08/aLaunchCenterProActionForTodotxt.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;A blog reader emailed the following question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I have texttool, draft and LCP apps on my iphone.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Please help me this issue. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I have todo.txt file in directory dropbox/todo/todo.txt &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I write in draft app one note with multiline line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Task1

Task2 

Task3 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I want to add this list to shown todo.txt (each line separate) in this format: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[current date] task1 @grocery 

[current date] task2 @grocery 

[current date] task3 @grocery 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;@grocery tag optional and may be replaced with other tag.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;How to do this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a solution that adds the current date before each list item and the single tag of your choice after each list item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://launchcenterpro.com/zlv5l6&quot;&gt;Import the LCP action&lt;/a&gt; or enter the following in the action composer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;texttool://x-callback-url/transform?text=[prompt-return:tasks]&amp;amp;method=affix&amp;amp;prefix=[textexpander:ddate]%20&amp;amp;suffix=%20%40[prompt:tag]&amp;amp;scope=lines
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I tap on this action, I enter each list item on a new line (hitting Return after each item except the last) and when I'm done I hit &quot;Next&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;apple

orange

banana
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the next prompt asks me to enter a tag:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;groceries
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action outputs the following in &lt;a href=&quot;http://blackfoggames.com/TextTool/&quot;&gt;TextTool&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;2014-07-08 apple @groceries

2014-07-08 orange @groceries

2014-07-08 banana @groceries
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above action requires that I have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://smilesoftware.com/apps/&quot;&gt;TextExpander&lt;/a&gt; snippet called &lt;em&gt;ddate&lt;/em&gt; in the following format: %Y-%m-%d, and that I have imported snippets into &lt;a href=&quot;http://contrast.co/launch-center-pro/&quot;&gt;Launch Center Pro&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Prepending the Output to the todo.txt File&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://launchcenterpro.com/99t4yt&quot;&gt;Import this action&lt;/a&gt; to prepend the output from TextTool to your &lt;em&gt;todo.txt&lt;/em&gt; file, or enter the following into the LCP action composer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;texttool://x-callback-url/transform?text=[prompt-return:tasks]&amp;amp;method=affix&amp;amp;prefix=[textexpander:ddate]%20&amp;amp;suffix=%20%40[prompt:tag]&amp;amp;scope=lines&amp;amp;x-success={{drafts:///create?text=[[output]]&amp;amp;action=todotxt}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above action requires that you &lt;a href=&quot;drafts://x-callback-url/import_action?type=dropbox&amp;amp;name=todotxt&amp;amp;path=%2Ftodo%2F&amp;amp;filenametype=2&amp;amp;filename=todo&amp;amp;ext=txt&amp;amp;writetype=1&amp;amp;template=%5B%5Bdraft%5D%5D&quot;&gt;import this Dropbox action&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=&quot;http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/&quot;&gt;Drafts&lt;/a&gt;. Or enter the following as a Dropbox action:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Name: todotxt

Path: /todo/

File (predefined): todo

Ext: txt

Write: Prepend

Template: [[draft]]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible to accomplish the above without LCP. &lt;a href=&quot;drafts://x-callback-url/import_action?type=URL&amp;amp;name=date-list-tag&amp;amp;url=texttool%3A%2F%2Fx-callback-url%2Ftransform%3Ftext%3D%5B%5Bbody%5D%5D%26method%3Daffix%26prefix%3Dddate%2520%26suffix%3D%2520%2540%5B%5Btitle%5D%5D%26scope%3Dlines%26x-success%3D%7B%7Bdrafts%3A%2F%2F%2Fcreate%3Ftext%3D%5B%5Boutput%5D%5D%26action%3Dtodotxt%7D%7D&quot;&gt;Import this URL action&lt;/a&gt; into Drafts, or enter the following as an URL action:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;texttool://x-callback-url/transform?text=[[body]]&amp;amp;method=affix&amp;amp;prefix=ddate%20&amp;amp;suffix=%20%40[[title]]&amp;amp;scope=lines&amp;amp;x-success={{drafts:///create?text=[[output]]&amp;amp;action=todotxt}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only difference is that you need to enter the tag name on the first line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;groceries

apple

orange

banana
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything else works exactly the same. (You still need to install the Dropbox action and to import TextExpander snippets.)&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>How to Get the SoundCloud URL Schemes for Users and Tracks</title>
			<link>http://blog.jeffreykishner.com/2014/07/08/howToGetTheSoundcloudUrlSchemesForUsersAndTracks.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;SoundCloud has url schemes to jump to a user or a specific track in the iOS app. I have cobbled the following together after reading a few threads on Stack Overflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How to Create a User URL Scheme&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's get the url scheme for &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/tashablank&quot;&gt;Tasha Blank&lt;/a&gt;. Click on the share icon &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-external-link&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; then choose the Embed tab and then copy the embed code into a text editor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/users/325143&amp;amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;amp;visual=true&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look for &lt;code&gt;api.soundcloud.com/users/&lt;/code&gt;. Copy the numerical string immediately after that, up until the &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;. Put that string after &lt;code&gt;soundcloud://users/&lt;/code&gt; and you'll get &lt;a href=&quot;soundcloud://users/325143&quot;&gt;soundcloud://users/325143&lt;/a&gt;. If you click on this link on your iOS device, it will bring you to her page. And you can add it to &lt;a href=&quot;http://contrast.co/launch-center-pro/&quot;&gt;Launch Center Pro&lt;/a&gt; in an action or list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How to Create a Track URL Scheme&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's get the url scheme for &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/tashablank/live-the-get-down-62614&quot;&gt;one of Tasha's recent tracks&lt;/a&gt;. Click on the share icon &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-external-link&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; then choose the Embed tab and then copy the embed code into a text editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/156299506&amp;amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;amp;visual=true&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look for &lt;code&gt;api.soundcloud.com/tracks/&lt;/code&gt;. Copy the numerical string immediately after that, up until the &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;. Put that string after &lt;code&gt;soundcloud://tracks/&lt;/code&gt; and you'll get &lt;a href=&quot;soundcloud://tracks:156299506&quot;&gt;soundcloud://tracks:156299506&lt;/a&gt;. If you click on this link on your iOS device, it will bring you to that track and start to auto-play. And you can add it to &lt;a href=&quot;http://contrast.co/launch-center-pro/&quot;&gt;Launch Center Pro&lt;/a&gt; in an action or list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know how else to get track and user IDs without signing up for a developer account, but if you find a solution, please let me know in the comments or on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kishner&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
